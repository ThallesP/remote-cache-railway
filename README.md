# üöÇ Self-Hosted Turborepo Remote Cache on Railway

Deploy a secure, self-hosted Turborepo remote cache on Railway with just a few clicks. This alternative provides you full control over your build cache infrastructure. üîí

## Setup Guide 

### 1. Deploy to Railway with One Click üéØ  
[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.com/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/tRFTHR?referralCode=chIZYq)

Simply click the Deploy on Railway button above to instantly set up your remote cache.

### 2. Configure Turborepo Project üõ†Ô∏è

After deploying, you'll need to configure your Turborepo project to use the new remote cache:

1. Open your Railway project we just deployed
2. Select the service with the Turborepo logo
3. Navigate to the "Variables" tab
4. Copy these required environment variables:
  - `TURBO_TOKEN`: Authentication token
  - `TURBO_API_URL`: Remote cache endpoint

### 3. Update Turborepo Configuration üìù

Time to modify your code to use the remote cache, but trust me, it's easy.  
Set the following environment variables that you copied from the Railway project we just deployed:

```properties
# When deploying your code on the same Railway project as this template, you can use ${{"Turborepo Remote Cache".TURBO_TOKEN}}
TURBO_TOKEN=
# When deploying your code on the same Railway project as this template, you can use ${{"Turborepo Remote Cache".TURBO_PRIVATE_API_URL}}
TURBO_API_URL= 
# Leave this as is
TURBO_TEAM=railway-remote-cache
```

And in case you prefer `.env` file instead of filling out those env variables in your shell everytime, you can use the `dotenv-cli` package.
Modify the `build` script in your `package.json` root to include the following:

```bash
dotenv -e .env -- turbo build
```

### 4. Use Remote Cache üéâ

Run your Turborepo commands as normal. The remote cache will be automatically utilized:

```bash
turbo build
```
You can verify the remote cache is working by checking your Turborepo build logs. When successful, you'll see:

```
Remote caching enabled
```

## Troubleshooting üîç

### Common Issues
- Verify Railway deployment is running and accessible
- Double-check that your token and API URL are correctly configured
- Test the setup using the [example reference project](https://github.com/ThallesP/remote-cache-railway) to validate configuration and rule out any potential template-specific issues
